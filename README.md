# Simple React Weather App
This is a simple react weather app built on top of create-react-app. I built this for educational purposes only and I
have no commercial intentions with it. This app is by no means very polished or anything, because like I said, I built
this to learn the framework and practice React.

I have made use of several third party components and modules to make my life easier.
Some notable mentions are isEmptyObj helper, erik flowers weather map icons, Material UI components (Autocomplete,
Icon Buttons, etc.)

This is makes use of Open Weather Map API. I noticed some discrepancies on how the data is returned in some cases. I would
have dealt with those problematic scenarios if I wanted to make money out of it. At this point, I would like to move on
to making something new and not spend time polishing the weird edge cases where the app might display erroneous data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
